# LSTM-Stock-Prediction-ARO

## Stock Price Prediction

### 🔍 Overview
Predict stock prices using a Deep LSTM model optimized with the Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO) algorithm.

### ⚙️ Features
- LSTM-based stock price prediction
- ARO for automated hyperparameter tuning
- Real-time stock data via yFinance
- Visual performance evaluation

### 🛠️ Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch matplotlib tensorflow keras sklearn yfinance
````

### 📈 Parameters

* `stock_name`: Ticker symbol (e.g., `"TSLA"`)
* `stock_timeframe`: Historical data period (e.g., `"10y"`)
* `initial_guess`: Initial hyperparameter vector for ARO
* `ARO_max_iters`: Max iterations for ARO
* `ARO_npop`: Population size
* `LSTM_epochs`: Number of LSTM training epochs

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Fetch Data** – Downloads stock data using `yfinance` and engineers additional features.
2. **Preprocess** – Scales data and generates sequences for LSTM.
3. **Build Model** – Configurable LSTM network with Dense and Dropout layers.
4. **Optimize** – Uses ARO to find best LSTM architecture and dropout.
5. **Train & Predict** – Trains the LSTM model and evaluates performance.

### ▶️ Usage

```python
# Run ARO optimization
best_solution, best_fitness, history = ARO(
    fitness_func=compute_fitness,
    initial_guess=[10, 1, 5, 0, 15, 8, 0.7],
    max_it=20,
    npop=20
)

# Evaluate optimized model
compute_fitness(best_solution)
```

### 📊 Outputs

* Predicted vs actual stock price plots
* ARO convergence history
* Best LSTM configuration
